     * - set the `access` permission to `proofOrSignature()`, to prevent against unauthorized token operations
     *   - not doing this would imply that anyone can bypass token contract authorization and simply mint themselves tokens
     * - require the zkapp account to be new, using the `isNew` precondition.
     *   this guarantees that the access permission is set from the very start of the existence of this account.
     *   creating the zkapp account before deployment would otherwise be a security vulnerability that is too easy to introduce.
